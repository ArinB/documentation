=== Checking and setting the hostname

*railspro01* had the wrong hostname, _localhost_, after being rebooted.

To check the hostname type:

  hostname

Which should return:

  railsproXX.com

To set the hostname type:

  sudo hostname railsproXX.com

If this does not work type:

  sudo vi /etc/sysconfig/network

And change the line that says:

  HOSTNAME=./set_hostname.sh: line 14: dialog: command not found

To

  HOSTNAME=railsproXX.com
